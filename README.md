# Vehicle Management System (2017)
This Software Engineering Project was a group project to build a Vehicle Management System for a Mechanic Garage Workshop.
Majority of the code written by me can be found at "./GMSIS/src/vehicle/".

See the "SE_TestReport.pdf" for an outline of the module "vehicle" which I created for this project.
This document shows the requirements which were fullfilled along with UML diagrams and Screenshots of the final software.
