# VehicleManagementSystem
Software Engineering Project to build a Vehicle Mangement System for a mechanic workshop.

This project was a group project for a Vehicle Management System for a Mechanic Garage Workshop.
Majority of the code written by me can be found at "./GMSIS/src/vehicle/".

See the "SE_test_report.pdf" for an outline of the module "vehicle" which I created for this project.
This document shows the requirements which were fullfilled along with UML diagrams and Screenshots of the final software.
